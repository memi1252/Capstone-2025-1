Thank you for buying this music pack and supporting my brand. This pack consists of 8 songs with 67 tracks (including 47 loops and some layers) spread across all the songs to give you the flexibility you desire for your games.

Feel free to use this in whatever way you would like. You do not need to credit me but I would love to know when & how you use this music so that I can share your game with my audience.

I hope these tracks serve you well for your RPG and Sci-Fi games!

Feel free to contact me for custom music or if you have any questions at

Warmest Regards
